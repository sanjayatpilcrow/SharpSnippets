This repository has C# | .NET | XAML | Windows Phone code samples. Most of the code samples are referenced in posts I write on my blog - http://sharpsnippets.wordpress.com/. So, you can get more insight about the code in related post on my blog. In code files I will give the link to the related blog post, if one exists.

General notes about the code:
a. This is working code, but not production code.
b. Code follows universal C# code convention but might not follow your company's internal convention.
c. Code is more of POC and thus does not have full exception handling and parameter checking.
d. If you choose to use the code in production, do re-code to make it production ready.
